# TODO App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

This project uses [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) as the design library

This project is created as a mobile first web app, so it's responsive for all screen sizes.

## Backend
